This GitHub repository contains an implementation of a crop classification model using machine learning techniques.
# Crop Classification using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project aims to predict the types of crops based on various agricultural conditions using machine learning techniques. The classification model is designed to help farmers make informed decisions for optimized yield and resource management in precision agriculture.

## Key Features

- Utilizes popular Python libraries like scikit-learn, seaborn, and matplotlib for data processing, visualization, and model building.
- Includes the dataset used for training and testing the crop classification model.
- Implements preprocessing techniques to handle missing data, normalization, and feature scaling for improved model performance.
- Builds a machine learning model using logistic regression, a widely used classification algorithm.
- Performs hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model's performance using techniques like cross-validation and grid search.
- Tests the trained model on a separate test dataset to assess its accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and other classification metrics.
- Provides a detailed classification report to interpret the model's performance for each crop category.
- Includes a Jupyter notebook for data exploration, preprocessing, and model development, ensuring transparency and reproducibility.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
    https://github.com/45221nsh/agriculture_crop_recommendation.git
2. Install the required Python dependencies using `pip`:
3. Open the Jupyter notebook `Crop_Classification.ipynb` and follow the step-by-step instructions for data exploration, preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.
4. Feel free to experiment with different hyperparameters, algorithms, or additional agricultural datasets to improve the model's accuracy and performance.

## Contributions

Contributions to this project are welcome! If you have any suggestions, improvements, or new features to propose, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Collaboration can lead to a more robust and accurate model, benefiting the agricultural community worldwide.



## Acknowledgments

We would like to acknowledge the crop recommendation dataset creators for providing the agricultural data used in this project. Without their valuable contribution, this project would not have been possible.
